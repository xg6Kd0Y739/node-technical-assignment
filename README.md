# Node.js (NestJS) Technical Assignment

Welcome to the Node.js (NestJS) technical assignment. In this assignment, you will be working on a simplified version of the "Safebox" problem. Your task is to build a RESTful API using the NestJS framework and structure it using the Hexagonal Architecture. The duration of the assignment will be 45 minutes, it is not strictly necessary to complete the functionality to pass it, the important thing is the implementation quality.

## Problem Description

### Safebox API

Our next product launch is Safebox API, a remote-controlled safe that we sell to our customers to keep their belongings as secure as possible by providing them with the ability to control their safe remotely through a mobile app.

As you know, the API must be robust and secure enough to avoid leaks and security issues.

### Assignment Requirements

You need to create a NestJS application that exposes a RESTful API to interact with the safebox. The application should be structured using the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters architecture).

**API definition**:

[OpenAPI spec](./open-api.spec.yaml)

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on the following aspects:

1. Code organization and structure following the Hexagonal Architecture.
2. API endpoints correctly implemented according to the specification.
3. Solution completeness.

## Submission

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Complete the assignment.
3. Push your code to your forked repository.
4. Share the link to your forked repository with the team.

Good luck with your assignment & Happy coding!
